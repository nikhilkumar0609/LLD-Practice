#Designing a Task Management System

The Task Management System should:

Task Creation and Management: Enable users to create, update, and delete tasks.
User Management: Manage user accounts and associated tasks.
Task Assignment: Allow tasks to be assigned to specific users.
Task Tracking: Track the progress and status of tasks.
Notifications: Notify users about task deadlines and updates.
